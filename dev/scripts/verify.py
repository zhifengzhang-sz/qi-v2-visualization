"""The project's checks for a change: the make targets that check the paths it touches, run one after another.

What a commit requires is the project's, not an agent's: the pre-commit hook (dev/hooks/pre-commit) runs this on
the staged paths, for a commit made by any kind of agent or by hand.

    python3 dev/scripts/verify.py            # the staged paths (the hook)
    python3 dev/scripts/verify.py --all      # every target of the table
    python3 dev/scripts/verify.py --since REF

It checks the work tree, not the index. A path no target checks (the documents, the Makefile, flake.nix, this
script) is named and passes. Standard library only.
